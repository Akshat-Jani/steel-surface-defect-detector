# Steel Surface Defect Detection System

An end-to-end **industrial computer vision inspection system** built around a **two-stage anomaly-first pipeline**:
Autoencoder-based anomaly detection → CNN-based defect classification → visual explainability → interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### Overall Pipeline Architecture
![Pipeline Architecture](results_%26_assets/Pipeline_Architecture.PNG)

**Explanation**
- Autoencoder learns normal steel texture using defect-free samples only  
- Reconstruction error is used as an anomaly score  
- Only anomalous samples are forwarded to the classifier  
- CNN predicts defect category  
- Grad-CAM visualizes regions influencing the prediction

### Module-Level Structure

**Explanation**
- Clear separation of anomaly detection, classification, explainability, and UI  
- Modular design for training, inference, and visualization

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

- Anomaly-first filtering to reduce false positives  
- Autoencoder chosen to avoid exhaustive defect labeling  
- Grad-CAM used for interpretability, not decision logic  
- UI separated from model logic  
- Model binaries excluded to keep repository lightweight
